#A tensorflow implement of using the pre_train vgg16 model
Currentlyï¼Œtransfer learning, fine-tuning, and mul-task learning are popular in deep learning research and we may see them in many start-of-the-art networks.  

A pre-train model like ResNet, is ususally desired if we use above methods.  

So, in this experiment, I will use a pre-train vgg16 model to predict a dog for practice.

##Expriment preparation
Experiment environment: Ubuntu14.04, tensorflow 1.0.0, keras1.2.2  

Download the vgg16_weights and move it to working directory  
(URL:https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0Bz7KyqmuGsilT0J5dmRCM0ROVHc&export=download)  

Download a picture that contains a dog, move to working directory and rename it as 'dog.jpg'

##Notation
The pre_train weight we download is based on theano,not tensorflow.  

So i firstly set the image dimension ordering using ```K.set_image_dim_ordering('th')``` in ```vgg16.py``` as that setting is different between tensorflow and theano.
