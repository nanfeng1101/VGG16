##VGG16: A tensorflow implement of using the pre_train vgg16 model
Currentlyï¼Œtransfer learning, fine-tuning, and mul-task learning are popular in deep learning research and we may see them in many start-of-the-art networks.  

A pre-train model like ResNet, is ususally desired if we use above methods.  

So, in this experiment, I will use a pre-train vgg16 model to predict a dog
